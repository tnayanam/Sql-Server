So We need a SQL Server installed in the system. Once that is installed we need a GUI (SSMS) to interact with it. So we need to install that too. So firstly we need to connect to the SQL Server Engine
 via SSMS. 
		Provide Server Type: Database Engine.
        Server Name: It should be the Name or IP Address of that server.
		Authentication: Here we can give an authentication to connect. if we give "windows authentication" then we dont need to do anything because we are already logged into the windows. (Best)
		If we give SQL Server authentication then while installin the Sql Server we must have given one user and password that we need to use.
